            decided to walk around the building one more time. But knew if a spirit entered the building, he 
            never be able to leave again. 
            Anybody there? He got no reply
            He thought he heard something; he was afraid that a ghost had entered.  He ran up another floor 
            and locked himself in another room. As he stepped inside the room there was dark black smoke, 
            rose from the floor. Thomas covered his eyes and mouth.
