        <p class = "border">Thomas and Jack were both very scared
            Run! Thomas shouted, without looking back Thomas ran as far away from the creepy shadows. He 
            just kept on running without looking back
            Hey Jack, are you ok now, Thomas asked but there was no reply, he thought Jack might have taken
             a different corridor to divert them, but there was no noise.
            
            Thomas hid behind a shelf as he felt someone was approaching him. He soon realised that if he 
            closed the door which was opened when read the scripture, all this might stop. 
            He made a plan while he was in hiding and decided the only way to stay alive is to keep on
             running away from them.
