        <p class = "border">In a corner of a big busy city, there was a building that stood near a forest. 
            There were many haunted stories regarding the building that after midnight, strange noises would 
            be heard from it. The locals also claimed that after midnight people entering the building were 
            seen but never to be found later. Anyone who entered the building never made it out.
            There were rumours that in the building lived a tall dark man who was said to have magical powers 
            that normal people could not perform.
