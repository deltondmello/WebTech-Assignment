        <p class = "border">Aren’t you curious to where this leads jack asked?
            Absolutely not Thomas replied, how does it even know my name. how did the words appear, are you not afraid?
            
             You want to book’s, don’t you? You don’t get them unless you read it.
            
            Not happening, Thomas replied. Ill even add another book on jack said.
            
            There was only one thing that Thomas loved the most and that was reading, he only had a few other books. He wanted to finish reading them all. So he took a few deep breaths and whispered to him self its ok, its ok. He walked very slowly to the map, he was so slow that jack couldn’t tell if he was moving.
            
            Hurry up before it gets too late, Jack replied 
            
            Thomas got to the map, he tried to read what’s on the paper, suddenly a door opened, and they heard a loud noise so much so they had to cover their ears.
            There a voice came out, the leader is calling us, and a group of dark souls rushed out the door, at first they looked like normal people, but as soon as Jack and Thomas realised what they were screamed “ghosts”.
