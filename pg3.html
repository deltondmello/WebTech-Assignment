        <p class = "border">In place of the shadow of the dark person now stood a old map which represented 
          the spot of the building in olden times. Jack who was frightened a few minutes ago, suddenly had 
          the courage of view and analysing of the painting that was in front of him. He couldn’t help 
          himself to explore. He went near it and tried to touch it. Don’t touch it Thomas said, there could
           be something dangerous lined with it. Thomas finally had the courage to speak. But Jack couldn’t 
           resist, and proceeded nothing happened,

          Jack was quite thirsty, so he decided to drink water, but as he drank few drops of water fell to 
          the ground and turned into blood. And in a few seconds, it disappeared. And wording on the map had
           appeared “Only Thomas can understand this map”.
          
          Jack turned around and dared Thomas to read it.
