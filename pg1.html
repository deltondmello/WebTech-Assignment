        <p class = "border">Jack was a local boy who was very adventurous and always wanted something fun to 
          do. Oppositely Thomas was very careful and attentive. Despite their different characters they were 
          very good friends. On one day they were at Jacks house, Jack was very bored and suddenly an 
          adventurous flew cam to Jacks mind. Go exploring the abandoned Building. Thomas disagreed, said he
           wanted to read books.

          Thomas said, I have to say you have some amazing books, Jack replied that’s so boring, noting like 
          what a boy should do. Come on Thomas Lets go.           
          Thomas ignored him and kept reading his book. I’ll  give you more amazing books, Jack shouted. But
           Thomas kept on reading.
          
          After many persuasions Thomas agreed. They finally went near the street where the building stood. 
          Jack approached to take the first step. Thomas alerted Jack “don’t go in”, we don’t know what in 
          there. Jack replied oh come on don’t be such a baby, think about the books you’ll get. Thomas nodded 
          and slowly followed him.
          
          They both entered the mysterious building.
