        <p class = "border">As the 2 boys went deep into the building, things started to get creepier and
           creepier they thought they hearing strange sounds, and when they looked outside the one of the 
           windows the sky had already gotten a lot darker compared to when they entered the building.

          The boys were frightened but didnâ€™t say a word. Even Jack felt that the building was haunted. It 
          was very dark in some places and strangely things got very quiet. They appeared to be a shadow that
           sighted he was tall and very dark. They wanted to scream but realised they had lost the ability to talk. 
          
          Run, they both thought, but none of them knew which way was out as there many corridors. After looking 
          around for an exit, the shadow in front of them disappeared and in its place appeared a very old map which 
          represented the building spot.
