        <p class = "border">The shadow which Thomas had seen earlier, reminded him of the tall dark man, 
            it was just like a ghost, Thomas said to himself I will just ignore and enter the building to
             try and Jack.
            He found an alternate entrance to the building. And went in.
            
            He looked up in the dark and made his way inside the corridors. He eventually reached the place 
            where they had found the map.

            On there it was written that enter the room where the door was opened earlier, Thomas thought he
             could find the reason how this all started and decided to go into the room also in hope to find 
             Jack. 
            Once entered the door mysteriously shut, and Thomas and he was never seen again
