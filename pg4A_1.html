        <p class = "border">Ok then I’ll just go home nothing is going to happen, Thomas kept on thinking
             continually, once exiting the building, He ran down the empty street, they were no people only 
             spirits moving around and capturing people’s souls. 
            Out of fear Thomas started to run faster and faster. I hope this is only a dream Thomas sighed
             and Jack is still strong. He ran without hesitation and didn’t look back; he knew that if he 
             stopped, he would end up just like them.
            
            Even with him running so fast eventually one caught up with him, he lost his balance and didn’t 
            know what was happening to him. He lost his sight and fell to the ground his last words were 
            “Mom, Dad, no” these were the last words he said before he lost his life.
