        <p class = "border">Jack where should we go Thomas asked, what should we do to get rid of them.
            But Thomas got no reply,  Thomas shouted Jack are you there.
            Thomas turned around only to find out that Jack had disappeared, he was lucky that the spirits 
            didn’t catch up to him, but he wasn’t relived as jack wasn’t present.
            No way Thomas whispered, the spirits must have caught Jack, what if his parents ask where he is,
             what am going to respond too. He kept thinking and thinking.
            Suddenly Thomas heard a voice “get away from me”, it must have been Jack, Thomas thought, he saw 
            Jack trying to let go of the spirits which were trying to trap him, Thomas started to run 
            thinking that eventually Jack would catch up. 
            The next moment the dark man appeared in front of Thomas, but he didn’t stop running, he cried 
            Jack run, but in a second Jack was nowhere to be seen.
            Thomas tried to think where he would go next.
