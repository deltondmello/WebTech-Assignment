        <p class = "border">Thomas somehow escaped the dark treacherous building to find out, that the city 
            was ghosted and there was no one to be seen. He ran around to find people to tell what had 
            happened, but eventually reached a nearby police station. He went to cross the street to get 
            inside the building, walked around the whole building but there was no one to be found, he 
            eventually went in one of the cabins and locked himself holding a knife, as there are moving
             spirits outside on the streets. Then he came across surveillance camera which were around the 
             city, he could see the whole city was turning ghostly and deadly. He also some police officers 
             directing people to safe areas. Thomas decided he would go and save Jack from the building.
